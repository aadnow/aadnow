## Hi, I'm Drew!

I have more than 15 years of experience in strategic communications, with a specialty in **executive communications and employee engagement**.

I learned this discipline, honed my craft, and earned a reputation for delivering excellence while serving leading global technology companies -- some for more than a decade.

I have served in both agency and in-house communications leadership roles, managed high-performing teams with more than a dozen direct reports and multi-million-dollar budgets, and I have also run lean virtual comms shops using freelancers to supplement in-house agency resources to deliver impact. I can get up to speed quickly -- learn, analyze, synthesize, and deliver clarity to topics of the day. I keep cool during high-stakes circumstances, step up to help solve problems regardless of who â€˜ownsâ€™ them, settle nerves, bolster confidence, and coach people to be their best when it matters most.

With my experience, skillset, growth mindset, commitment to an inclusive workplace that makes space for everyone to thrive -- plus a strong creative impulse and technical execution skills, I try to model capable leadership that is as happy doing the work as in coaching others to learn and grow to succeed.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss your goals and how I might contribute to your team.
