## Hi, I'm Drew!

I have more than 15 years of experience in strategic communications, with a specialty in **executive communications and employee engagement**. 

I learned this discipline, honed my craft and earned a reputation for delivering excellence while serving leading global technology companies -- some 		for more than a decade.
  
I have served in both agency and in-house communications leadership roles, managed teams with more than a dozen direct reports and multi-million-dollar budgets and I have also run lean virtual comms shops using freelancers to supplement in-house agency resources to deliver impact. I keep cool during high-stakes circumstances, step up to help solve problems regardless of who â€˜ownsâ€™ them, settle nerves, bolster confidence and help people be their best when it matters most.

With my experience, skillset, growth mindset, commitment to an inclusive workplace that help everyone thrive -- plus a strong creative impulse and technical execution skills, I hope to offer a unique leadership and partnership profile. 

I welcome the opportunity to discuss your goals and how I might contribute to your team
